## eli5 (explain like i'm 5)

Webpack is used when:

1. Any changes to `/scripts` or `/styles` is rebuilt by webpack.
1. The new files are linked inside the ignored file `_includes/webpack.njk` thanks to [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin).
1. Eleventy sees the new `_includes/webpack.njk` and rebuild.
1. Browsersync sees the changes and refresh.

Any other changes is picked up normally by Eleventy.

## Usage

First install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then you can:

| Command               | Description                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **`npm run start`**   | Run your website on http://localhost:8080    |
| **`npm run build`**   | Build your production website inside `/dist` |
| **`npm run format`**  | Run prettier on `scripts/*` `and styles/*`   |
| **`npm run analyze`** | Output info on your bundle size              |

That's it.
